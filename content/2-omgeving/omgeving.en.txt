In the past years, harbor locations have become increasingly popular as residential areas, because of their unique qualities. The old view of a harbor as purely a working environment has been transformed to a lively neighborhood for living, recreation, and relaxation. The water, quay, fishing boats, and yachts give the harbor a romantic character.

The Scheveningen harbor is currently being transformed—not only are new living spaces being built, but also other features that will benefit future residents. Already, a supermarket, bank, and various restaurants and cafés are all within walking distance.

With the Scheveningen beach and boulevard on one side, and the southern beach on the other, this is the dream location of every sea and beach lover.

Shopping streets such as the Frederik Hendriklaan and the Keizerstraat are within a stone's throw of the harbor.
