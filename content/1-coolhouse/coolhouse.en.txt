<h2 class="slab-headline"><span class="slabtext">Spacious living in the harbor of Scheveningen</span></h2>

With the development of the Cool-house, The Hague will gain an addition befitting its versatile character. The former location of a refrigeration house for the fishing industry in the harbor of Scheveningen will make room for an extraordinary and modern housing complex.

The qualities of the situation are used optimally by the architecture of DAVL Studio, and result in a unique building. The sensation and allure of living in the harbor will be fully realized by the Cool-house.

Generous proportions, excellent orientation towards the sun, large balconies, and a panoramic view make these not just apartments, but penthouses and lofts. Freedom is the key word with Cool-house. Close co-operation with the (interior) architect ensures that future residents can receive fully personalized layouts. A unique chance to make this your dream house.

Cool-house is currently under development and the start of building activities is planned for summer 2016.
