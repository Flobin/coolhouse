The CoolHouse offers spacious penthouses of ca. 308m &#178; and lofts of ca. 154m &#178;, spread across seven floors. The apartments, which are surrounded by balconies, can be completely custom designed to ensure that future residents can live in their dream house. By closely cooperating with the (interior) architect personal layouts will be defined in an early stage. This makes the CoolHouse a unique chance to put your personal wishes and needs into the home. 

The project also contains four fantastic houses on the Koppelstokstraat of ca. 226m &#178; each.

In the image below you can see which homes are still available (in white/light blue) and which have been reserved (in dark blue).
